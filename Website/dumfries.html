    <h2>Ellie's Dumfries discoveries...</h2>

    <p>Dumfries and Galloway has managed to cater to all of my outdoor cravings, which is no mean feat! The region boasts beautiful forests, idyllic lochs, rolling pastures and the enchanting Solway Firth. </p>

    My first adventure was to Mabie forest, to catch the last of the autumn colours. The trees were stunning with their changing leaves and crisp autumnal scents. I have found a lovely route from the hospital accommodation to the forest, which takes me right past the Mabie farm, home to some adorable goats that are far from camera-shy!


    <p> As a keen wild-swimmer I have made sure to immerse myself in the local lochs. Ᾱine, Lina and myself visited Loch Arthur this week, which was invigorating to say the least. We managed to swim quite far out and into the sunshine that was beating down on the ripples. I still haven’t made up my mind as to how loch swimming compares to <a href="https://scotgem.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2020/09/29/the-silver-dark-sea/">the silver dark sea...</a> </p>

    
    <p> The GP practice that I go to each Wednesday happens to be right near the sea. On the first week, my group took the scenic route home, alongside the Solway Firth. It felt so good to be able to breathe in the salty air, something I have missed after moving away from St Andrews! </p>
